# reinventing-minesweeper-2.0

This project is simply for practicing and learning how the Godot engine works (alongside GDscript and Jetbrains Rider IDE) compared to what I've used in the past.

Now when the project is done, there's a ton of improvements I would do to the codebase. But, I think it's best if I apply what I've learned to my next future projects.

Anyways!
